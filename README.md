# unit-4-game
This project contains a random number guessing game. Its imperative that you have a good memory and can add :). This pages was designed using Bootstrap and are responsive.

Overview
1. You will be given a random number from 19 to 120 at the start of the game.

2. There are four crystals. By clicking on a crystal you will add a specific amount of points (1 to 12) to your total score.

3. You win the game by matching your total score to a random number, you lose the game if your total score goes above the random number.

4. The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you clock on it.

5. Each time when the game starts, the game will change the values of each crystal.
